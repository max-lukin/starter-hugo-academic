Being a person with a strong mathematical understanding of the methods used in simulation modelling,\
as well as experience in structural mechanics, I am going to get a master’s degree at a German university.\
I assume it will expand my professional horizons. Also, I am proud to have advanced knowledge of speaking and writing English, and I still continue attending the German courses. I am a flexible person for different projects in all sectors of modelling and structural analysis.

Working for leading German company would widen my perspectives by giving me incomparable to anything experience in innovative composing and allow me to start my international career. Your company would give me an opportunity to reveal myself as a part of a professional team.
